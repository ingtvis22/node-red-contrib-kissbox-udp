THE NETWORK ANSWER
Audiences are ever more expecting to be amazed. Designers and technicians working in the entertainment industry, theme-parks, museums, live shows, movies and many other types of venues need solutions that enable them to create and control complex networks. At lowest-as-possible-cost and with highest-as-possible reliability.

KissBoxes are designed as a simple way to transmit-receive control protocol-data like MIDI, DMX, RS232/422/485, LTC-Timecode, Contact-Closure, Analog Control-voltage and more, over standard Ethernet networks. With minimum and controlled latency.

THE KISS PRINCIPLE
KISS is an acronym for “Keep it simple, stupid”, a design principle noted by the US Navy in the 1960’s. The KISS principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple. Therefore simplicity is a key objective in our KissBox designs.
